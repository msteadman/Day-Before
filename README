The "Day Before" Project
========================

A step beyond "Hello, World".

Scripts that take a date in the format YYYY-MM-DD as input, and
output the previous day's date as YYYYMMDD. The original was in Perl,
and I later realized it made for a nice, little programming exercise 
when learning a new language.

It's a simple problem with a simple solution, but it involves
parsing command line input, printing output, and date math, so you
have to learn some of the language's standard modules.
